# JS_Pet-Project_Restaurant_website
Project create website for restourant with menu bar
that include different category of dishes.
The website features a userÂ­friendly menu bar with
different categories of dishes, allowing customers to
easily navigate and find their desired options. 
Additionally, the main page includes a map feature
that enables users to input their delivery address for a
convenient ordering experience. 
To enhance the website's visual appeal and
promotional efforts, I created dynamic sliders(used
slick library) that showcase special offers and
promotions to engage customers. 
Creates page with dishes by categories also the
possibility of sorting. Each dish has its own product
page, where customers can access additional
information and even add items to their basket where
user can adjust the quantity of items. 
I implemented buttons that enable users to switch
between different product cards seamlessly.
In order to gather necessary delivery information
from customers, I integrated a modal window that
efficiently captures and stores user data.
